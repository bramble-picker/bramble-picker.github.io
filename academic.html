                    <p> I'm a PhD researcher in the Media and Arts Technology CDT at Queen Mary University of London. My research involves using computational methods to understand fundamental structures of comics. </p>
                    
                    <p> The research questions I'm interested in are: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>How should units of analysis be defined to effectively study the structure of comics? </li>
                        <li>Why do comic writers and artists decide to structure their work the way that they do? What sort of decisions do they make in their process of comics creation? </li>
                        <li>Which theoretial foundations from linguistics have been applied to the study of comics, and is this the best way to approach comics research?
                        </li>
                        <li>Can comics structures be modelled adeqautely to successfully generate a novel comic from a script?
                        </li>
                        <li>What can comics express that no other medium can express?
                        </li>
                        <li>How can comics be used to explain and disseminate current academic research to the wider public?</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p> At the moment, I'm developing a general model of common comics structures from corpus analyses. I'll then try to describe how the different parts and structures relate to each other using constraint solving methods. The final model can be used to examine which structures tend to work well, and which do not work so well. </p>
                    
                    <p> More generally, I would like to better understand how thoughts can manifest in visual sequences or notations. I have a background in philosophy, sociology, and art practice. I've previously completed an MA in Language and Cognition at King's College London and an MA in Sociology at Bielefeld University in Germany. </p>
