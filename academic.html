                    <p> I'm a PhD researcher interested in comics. The research questions I'm interested in are: Why do comic writers and artists decide to structure their work the way that they do? What sort of decisions do they make in their process of comics creation?</p>
                    
                    <p> At the moment, I'm using computational methods to investigate this. I am annotating a comics corpus to demarcate how all space on each comic page is used. Then I'll try to describe how the areas relate to each other using constraint solving methods. </p>
                    
                    <p> Overall, I would like to better understand how thoughts can manifest in visual sequences, or notations. I have a background in philosophy, sociology, and art practice. I've completed an MA in Language and Cognition at King's College London and an MA in Sociology at Bielefeld University in Germany. </p>
